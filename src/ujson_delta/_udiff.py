Functions for computing udiffs.

The data structure representing a udiff that these functions all
manipulate is a pair of lists of iterators ``(left_lines,
right_lines)``.  These lists are expected (principally by
generate_udiff_lines(), which processes them), to be of the same
length.  A pair of iterators ``(left_lines[i], right_lines[i])`` may
yield exactly the same sequence of output lines, each with ``' '``
as the first character (representing parts of the structure the
input and output have in common).  Alternatively, they may each
yield zero or more lines (referring to parts of the structure that
are unique to the inputs they represent).  In this case, all lines
yielded by ``left_lines[i]`` should begin with ``'-'``, and all
lines yielded by ``right_lines[i]`` should begin with ``'+'``.
